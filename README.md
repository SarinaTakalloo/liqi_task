It's difficult to determine whether a company is able to borrow money based solely on these three ratios as there are other factors that lenders may consider when evaluating a company's creditworthiness. However, we can interpret the ratios based on their numbers.

The debt-to-liability ratio of 0.0514 indicates that the company has a low amount of debt relative to its total liabilities. This may be viewed positively by lenders as it indicates that the company has a lower risk of defaulting on its debt obligations.

The debt service coverage ratio of 1.420 indicates that the company is generating enough operating income to cover its debt payments. This is generally viewed positively by lenders as it indicates that the company is financially stable and has the ability to repay its debts.

The current ratio of 1.021 indicates that the company has enough current assets to cover its current liabilities. This is also viewed positively by lenders as it indicates that the company is able to meet its short-term obligations.

Based on these ratios, it's possible that the company may be able to borrow money from another company. However, it's important to note that lenders may also consider other factors such as the company's credit history, revenue, cash flow, and industry trends when evaluating creditworthiness.
