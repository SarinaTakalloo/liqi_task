It's difficult to determine whether a company is able to borrow money based solely on these three ratios as there are other factors that lenders may consider when evaluating a company's creditworthiness. However, we can interpret the ratios based on their numbers.

The debt-to-liability ratio of 0.0514 indicates that the company has a low amount of debt relative to its total liabilities. This may be viewed positively by lenders as it indicates that the company has a lower risk of defaulting on its debt obligations.

The debt service coverage ratio of 1.420 indicates that the company is generating enough operating income to cover its debt payments. This is generally viewed positively by lenders as it indicates that the company is financially stable and has the ability to repay its debts.

The current ratio of 1.021 indicates that the company has enough current assets to cover its current liabilities. This is also viewed positively by lenders as it indicates that the company is able to meet its short-term obligations.

Based on these ratios, it's possible that the company may be able to borrow money from another company. However, it's important to note that lenders may also consider other factors such as the company's credit history, revenue, cash flow, and industry trends when evaluating creditworthiness.
It's not possible to determine exactly how much money a company can borrow based solely on these ratios. Lenders typically use a variety of factors when determining how much money to lend, including the company's credit history, cash flow, revenue, collateral, and other financial and non-financial considerations.

However, some lenders may use these ratios as a part of their evaluation process. For example, some lenders may use the debt service coverage ratio to determine whether a company can generate enough income to repay the debt. Typically, lenders will require a DSCR of at least 1.2 or 1.25, meaning that the company's operating income is at least 1.2 or 1.25 times the amount of its debt payments. Based on the DSCR of 1.420 in your example, it appears that the company's income is sufficient to cover its debt payments.

Lenders may also consider the current ratio as an indicator of a company's ability to repay its debts. A current ratio of 1.0 or higher is generally viewed positively as it indicates that the company has enough current assets to cover its current liabilities. However, lenders may also consider other factors such as the quality and liquidity of the company's assets.

In summary, while these ratios can be useful indicators of a company's financial health, lenders typically use a variety of factors when determining how much money to lend.

To calculate the maximum amount that can be granted to the company, we would need more information about its financials, such as its revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and cash flow projections. Without this information, it's not possible to determine the maximum amount that can be granted with certainty.

However, as a general rule, lenders typically use a variety of factors when determining how much money to lend, including the company's credit history, cash flow, revenue, collateral, and other financial and non-financial considerations.

For short-term funding requests (less than 12 months), lenders may consider the company's cash flow projections and ability to generate sufficient cash to repay the loan within the specified timeframe. The lender may also consider the company's creditworthiness, including its credit score, payment history, and other factors that may indicate its ability to repay the loan.

Based on this information, the lender may offer a loan amount that is commensurate with the company's ability to repay the loan within the specified timeframe, while also taking into account any collateral or other factors that may mitigate the risk of default.

Ultimately, the maximum amount that can be granted will depend on the lender's assessment of the company's financial health and creditworthiness, as well as the lender's own lending policies and risk appetite.
